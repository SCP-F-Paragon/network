This allocated billions of dollars in funding and the assistance of the United Nation\u2019s primary anomalous organization, the Global Occult Coalition, to the Foundation. With this influx of financial and human resources, the SCP Foundation would begin construction of its most ambitious secure facility to date, which would serve the primary function of researching the potential of controllable anomalous weapons of war.

The facility was decided to be located within the San Juan Mountains, Colorado. Its area on the surface would consist of an isolated forest sixteen kilometers in diameter that was closed off on all sides from the public. This area was hidden under the guise of a wildlife sanctuary overseen by the National Parks Service. Also, under an agreement with the military, the United States Air Force also enforces a no-fly zone in the airspace over the facility. In the late fall of 1963, Paragon Research Institute was officially activated and placed on Foundation records after enough personnel, and SCP objects from all over the world were transferred to it. Since its activation, the facility continues to undergo construction and expansion."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
